# Win Probability Predictor

This repository contains a Python-based project for predicting the win probabilities of sports teams in various matchups. The primary tool is a Jupyter Notebook that implements machine learning models to calculate and compare probabilities for home and away teams, ultimately determining the predicted winner for each game.

## Features

- **Win Probability Prediction**: Calculates win probabilities for home and away teams using a trained machine learning model.
- **Dynamic Team Matchups**: Allows predictions for specific team matchups provided by the user.
- **Batch Predictions**: Supports predictions for multiple games happening on a given day.
- **Outcome Determination**: Identifies the predicted winner based on probabilities.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sehej-Git/nba-win-predictions.git
   cd nba-win-predictions
